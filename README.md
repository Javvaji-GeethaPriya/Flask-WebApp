- **Database Integration**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy to interact with a SQLite database, handling user data and other persistent information.
- **Template Rendering**: Leverages Jinja2 templating engine for dynamic HTML content.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic HTML and CSS are used to ensure the app is accessible on different devices.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling mechanisms are in place to manage user inputs and application flow.
